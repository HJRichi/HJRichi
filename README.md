- 👋 Hi, I’m @HJRichi
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, more specifically in application programming. I love it when a plan (or program) works. My goal is for the customer to use my program every day and make their work easier.
- 🌱 In my more than 30 years of programming, I have worked with several programming languages and frameworks. Currently I am focusing on Python, R, Jupyter Notebook with Tensorflow. So far, SQL and Excel have been the focus of my work with data. Big data takes on many new aspects. I am currently building chatbots with Google DialogFlow, Amazon Alexa and Cognigy.AI. At some point I will have to decide in which direction I will specialize.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on specific projects. Knowledge that is not applied is worthless.

- 😄 Pronouns: I feel very sorry for anyone who doesn't know whether they are male or female. I'm a man. I prefer the “you” form when getting to know someone for the first time. It expresses recognition and respect. However, I don't have a problem with the "you" form.
